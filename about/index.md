I am a software engineer with a focus on web technologies. I bring equally
a passion for problem solving and a collaborative spirit. My philosophy is
to make the world a better place in whatever small ways that I can through
my contribution to the quality of product, by being a friendly and capable
worker and by writing maintainable code.

In my free time I love to [watch movies](https://letterboxd.com/kevin33/), travel
and play soccer. Fun facts: I speak basic [Quechua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quechuan_languages) (the most widely spoken indigenous language in the
Americas) and I spent five summers working on a fishing boat in Alaska.
