I am a software developer with experience in manufacturing automation and web technologies. I have a degree in Computer Science from the University of Michigan. See how I can help your organization by reaching out to me at <a href="mailto:keenanjt@gmail.com">keenanjt@gmail.com</a>.

In my free time I love to [watch movies](https://letterboxd.com/kevin33/), travel
and play soccer. Fun fact: I speak basic [Quechua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quechuan_languages)&mdash;the most widely spoken indigenous language in the
Americas.
